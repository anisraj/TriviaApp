Here is the brief overview what I used for completing this task:

I created all screens that mentioned in this task,
For navigating within different screens , I Used navigation Graph with fragments.

For storing data, I had used Room Database.
Created Repository class for code sepration, using this class we can access multiple data sources. 

Used LiveData for getting data from database, so we can observe data.   

For attaching data in recyclerview ViewHolders , I had used Data Binding.

Used ViewModel for communicating between UI and Repository class.
